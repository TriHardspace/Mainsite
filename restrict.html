<h2>Our official statement on the RESTRICT act.</h2>
<p>Recently, the federal government of the United States has introduced a bill that if enacted will make law <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/f/3f2eaae6-09ad-49e1-b254-46289cf20cca/843D73B1823EA0D4122B4365262410D6.restrict-act-final-text.pdf">the RESTRICT act</a> (also known as the "ban TikTok bill"). A piece of legislation that is proported to help tackle national security threats from foreign technology companies. The contents of this legislation, despite being "aimed at" foreign companies would <strong>severely undermine our core operations</strong>. It gives the federal government broad powers to "identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate â€¦ any risk arising from any covered transaction by any person, or with respect to any property" that the secretary determines to pose "an undue or unacceptable risk".</p>

<p> While at first a piece of legislation that is proported to strengthen our national security (especially at a time when cybersecurity in general in this country is commonly agreed to be inadequate) does not seem like it would have undue consequenes for The Battalion (a domestic organization with a high percentage of domestic users) it is extremely broad at best and impossible to understand and implement effectively at worst. Given that a violation is "a transaction in which an entity described in subparagraph (B) has any interest." where said party is (a) "foreign adversary; an entity subject to the jurisdiction of, or organized under the laws of, a foreign adversary; and an entity owned, directed, or controlled by" we believe that this bill is incredibly broad and has widespread implications beyond simply protecting national security. In our interpretation, <strong>providing any service at all to any foreign person or other entity could be made a federal crime if our government so much as decides they do not like them</strong>. This can even happen without ever having to publicly disclose any reason as the bill has exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act.  </p>

<p>The implications go beyond specifically providing services though, stating that "no person may cause or aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, permit, or approve the doing of any act prohibited by, or the omission of any act required by any regulation, order, direction, mitigation measure, prohibition, or other authorization or directive issued under, this Act,". This section alone tears down crucial protections of liablility that make it possible for us to exist (like those in Section 230). Currently we are not seen in the eyes of the law as the publishers of the content that exists on our services, but if simply "aid[ing]" in a violation of the act is enforcable we have a responsibility for every single word, image, video, etc.. that one might upload or otherwise share here. For instance, <strong>the existence alone of content that would potentially violate this act such as a VPN profile, privacy guide, application binaries or source code, etc.. could all be made criminal.</strong> This directly goes against every part of freedom of speech and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>There are other reasons you should care as well that go beyond just The Battalion, as both the providers and users of aforementioned services like VPNs or Proxies and their ISPs could be held responsible for the actions of you as a user circumventing a PROTECT restriction. <strong>Even hardware manufactures of devices could be penalized for not blocking certain software, this could singlehandedly kill sideloading on mobile and make the desktop ecosystem limited to the like of package managers and app stores.</strong> A threat this big against your soverignty should not be ignored.</p>

<p>"This legislation is only to be used against foreign adversaries!" is the message commonly given by government officials when questioned on why anyone would ever be in support of such legislation. However it takes less then speculation to determine that it could easily be used against domestic citizens, look to the PATRIOT act among other things to see how this is never truly the case. Even if a court deems this legislation unusable against individuals or domestic orginizations, it doesn't mean that a prosecutor will not try. Are you signing up to be first? We aren't.</p>

<p>The Battalion is an orginization that was founded with 2 specific purposes, the first of which is to provide free to use and open source services for public benefit. Thousands of people around the world make use of said services on a regular basis to communicate freely, share information, and make amazing things happen. We do not want to live in a world where our freedoms are under even more threat then they already face, the RESTRICT act will almost certainly make that a reality. We hope that everyone reading this shares that vision to a point, and does something about it.  </p>

<p>While there never has been any obligation to you in exchange for the services we provide, we ask that if you use our services, if you support our mission, or even just if you care at all about this, and you are an American that you take the following steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>Contact your representatives immediately and let them know that you oppose the RESTRICT act.</li>
<li>Share the word around with your American friends and family members.</li>
<li>Make sure that any politician that is in support of taking away the freedom of speech of yourself and others loses your vote.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="text-danger">Please act now before it is too late. Freedom of speech online is under threat.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>
